# landing-page

The landing page will consist of completing a full style display of a modern homepage on a typical website. In order to complete this project.
using HTML and CSS is essential to building the foundations. For styling, using the Flexbox model will be absolutely required to get all texts, images, and layouts
working the way it should. Updates will be added on this file as progression moves forward.

UPDATE 4/28/2025

Finished html code by building the foundations of the landing page and piecing together div elements for proper flexbox layouts, as well as completing the header portion in CSS.

UPDATE 4/29/2025

All CSS foundational code has been completed and implemented. During this part, I will attempt to fix any relying issues that deal with shrinking, squishing, wrapping, and possible padding/margin issues as well.

UPDATE 5/2/2025

Fixed issues with collapsing, when window is resized, borders will attempt to match window scale rather than maintain it's actual scaling, causing certain elements to overlap one another, blue box at the bottom page had an issue of completely disappearing if the window is squished, all of this is temporarily fixed by adding min-width declarations on certain classes. Proper flex-wrapping will be added at a later date.

In addition to this, all placeholder text and images have been replaced to add a more stylized page, giving it more flare and personality.
