using HTML and CSS is essential to building the foundations. For styling, using the Flexbox model will be absolutely required to get all texts, images, and layouts

UPDATE 4/28/2025

Finished html code by building the foundations of the landing page and piecing together div elements for proper flexbox layouts, as well as completing the header portion in CSS.

UPDATE 4/29/2025

All CSS foundational code has been completed and implemented. During this part, I will attempt to fix any relying issues that deal with shrinking, squishing, wrapping, and possible padding/margin issues as well.
